<P align="left">Intel's diagnostic software lets you test the adapter to see if 
there are any problems with the adapter hardware, the cabling, or the network 
connection. You can also use diagnostics to isolate problems during 
troubleshooting. There are four test programs documented here. Both test Intel<sup>&reg;</sup> adapters, and operate 
identically. </P>

operation and confirm the adapter's ability to
communicate with another adapter in the same network. They are not throughput measurement tools.&nbsp;</P>
<P align="left"><span id="lbDetails">The
</span>utilities <span id="lbDetails">can test the adapter whether or not there 
is a responder present. In order to do a thorough test, however, you should set 
a responder system prior to starting the test. If there are hot keys, the 
letters will be highlighted</span>.</P>

<h2 align="left"><a name="Test Adapter Menu">Test Adapter Menu</a></h2>
<P align="left">Selecting &quot;Test Adapter&quot; from the Main Menu brings up
the Test Menu. This allows you to test the adapter, select which tests to

<h3 align="left">Begin Adapter Tests</h3>
<P align="left">Selecting this option brings up the test screen. While tests are
being performed, a rotating spinner is shown letting the user know that the
application is still &quot;alive.&quot; The results of the tests are displayed as each
test is performed. If multiple test passes are selected, then the results
contain a count of test failures. A list containing zeros means that all tests have
passed.
Single tests will display &quot;Passed&quot; or &quot;Failed&quot; for each pass.</p><blockquote>

<P align="left">The test setup screen allows you to configure
and select the specific tests desired. Each option is toggled by moving the 
cursor with the arrow keys and pressing &lt;Enter&gt; to change the option. The number of tests is simply
entered from the keyboard in the appropriate box. <span id="lbDetails2">If there 
is a gap in the menu, that means the test is not supported by your adapter.</span> 
By default, local diagnostics run automatically, while network diagnostics are

  <p><b>Device Registers</b> - Test patterns are written, read and verified 
  through the adapter's
  device registers to ensure proper functionality. </p>
  <p><b>FIFOs</b> - This <span id="lbDetails0">utility </span>will write test bit patterns to
  the adapter's FIFO buffers, to make sure the FIFOs are
  working properly. <span id="lbDetails1">Not all adapters have FIFO, so it will 
  not appear in all test lists.</span></p>
  <p><b>EEPROM</b> - Tests both the readability of the EEPROM as well
  as the integrity of the data stored in the EEPROM. It reads the EEPROM and
  calculates the checksum. This checksum is then compared to the checksum stored
  in the EEPROM. If values are not the same, the test reports failure.</p>
  <p><b>Interrupt</b> - This  tests the adapter's ability to
  generate an interrupt. On EFI, interrupts are not supported. Therefore, this 
	test sets the interrupt cause register and reads the interrupt set register, 
	verifying the card internally registered an interrupt.</p>
  <p><b>MAC Loopback</b> and <b>PHY Loopback</b> - There are two internal loopback tests. These tests set the adapter in
  the appropriate loopback mode and send packets back through the adapter's
  receive circuitry and logic. These tests are chipset dependant and may not be 
	selectable.</p>
  <p><b>Link</b> - This checks to see if the
  adapter has link or does not have link.</p>
  <p><b>Network Test</b> - The Network Test looks for a responder, and then 
  sends  packets. If no responder is found, then the test reports failure.
  <span id="lbDetails3">If no link is found, it will also report a failure.
  </span>&nbsp;If packets are received back from the responder, the test 
  reports success.</p>

<h2>Networking Menu</h2>
<p>The networking menu contains network specific tests such as Spanning Tree 
detection and Network test responder.</p>
<p></p><blockquote><img border="0" src="network.gif" /></blockquote>
<h3><a name="Set Up as Responder">Set Up as Responder</a></h3>
<P>This allows the user to set up the adapter as a responder so
a connected system can perform the network test portion of the diagnostics tests. 
Although you can use a variety of adapters as the responder and connect directly 
or through a switch, the best results are obtained with a cross-over cable and a 
same-type adapter. </P>
<blockquote>
<P align="left"><img border="0" src="diag1016.gif" /></P>
</blockquote>
<p>When you press &lt;Esc&gt;,&nbsp; the
responder operation is cancelled and control is immediately returned to the 
Networking
menu.</p>
<h3>Detect Spanning Tree</h3>
<p>Spanning trees can be troublesome in a networking configuration. 
The Detect Spanning Tree option attempts to detect if a spanning tree exists on 
the network. This is done by resetting the link and listening for spanning tree 
packets.</p>
